		<p align="left"><b><h1>Summary:</h1></b>
		Sources of information vary, but it is estimated that one in
five children are physically, emotionally or sexually abused in
the United States. Unfortunately, there are those among the
uninformed public who believe that most abuse is nothing more
than parents exerting their “right” to discipline their children and
letting it get a little out of hand. These same people may believe
that overdiscipline is not likely to follow the child into
adulthood. They are tragically misinformed.
On any given day, some adult who is the victim of a dark past
of child abuse may vent his or her pentup frustrations on society
or on those he or she may love. The public is well informed
about the most uncommon cases. Unusual incidents attract the
media and boost ratings. Many child abuse victims hide their past deep inside, so deep
that the possibility of becoming an abuser themselves is
unthinkable. They live normal lives, becoming husbands and
wives, raising families and building careers. But the ordinary
problems of everyday life often force the former abuse victim to
behave as they were taught as children. Spouses and children
then become the object of their frustration, and they
unknowingly come the full circle, completing the neverending
cycle of rage.
Some child abuse victims stay quietly locked in their shells.
They look the other way, believing that by not acknowledging
their past it will go away. They seem to believe that above all
Pandora’s Box must stay closed.
Each year, millions of dollars are poured into child protection
agencies in the United States and around the world. These
dollars go to local facilities, like foster homes and juvenile halls.
There are dollar grants to thousands of private organizations
whose mission includes basic child abuse prevention, the
counseling of abusive parents and the victims. Every year the
number grows larger.
Why? What causes the tragedy of child abuse? Is it really as
bad as they say? Can it be stopped? And perhaps the most
important of all questions, what is abuse like through the eyes of
the child?
